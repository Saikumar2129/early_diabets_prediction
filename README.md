# Early Diabetes Prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes at an early stage using advanced machine learning techniques. Early prediction can lead to better management and prevention of diabetes, improving the quality of life for individuals at risk.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant features impacting diabetes prediction.
Model Training: Training various machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance to select the best one.
Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Python 3.9 
Libraries: pandas, numpy, sci-kit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains various medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome, indicating whether a patient has diabetes.

Columns:
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
